# Situation: Skills of Testing Team need to be improved. But the budget for extra training is very limited...

## ISTQB
- [ ] Why do many companies mention in QA job ads often that an "ISTQB certification would be great to have"?
- [ ] Where can we find an overview of all ISTQB certifications? [link](https://www.istqb.org/#certifications-diagram)
- [ ] Have a look at syllabus of the Foundation Level certification. Even without getting the exam, could just reading the syllabus help to improve skills of Testing Team?
- [ ] Could members of the Testing Team create flashcards to make learning a more "game-like experience"?
- [ ] Could members of the Testing Team create learning material in visually appealing MS PowerPoint format for self-study?
- [ ] In case we have already flash cards / learning material - have we put it under version control?
