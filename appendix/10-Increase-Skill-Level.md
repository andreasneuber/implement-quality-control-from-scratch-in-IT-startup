# Situation: Skills of Testing Team need to be improved. But we have no resources yet to offer them free extra education...

## ISTQB
- [ ] Why do other companies mention in QA job ads often that an "ISTQB certification would be great to have"?
- [ ] Where can one find an overview of all ISTQB certifications?
- [ ] Have a look at syllabus of the Foundation Level certification. Even without getting the exam, could just reading the syllabus help to improve skills of Testing Team?
- [ ] Could we provide the Testing Team with flashcards to make learning a more "game-like experience"?
- [ ] Do we have any learning material in visually appealing MS PowerPoint format for self-study?
