# Implement Quality Control From Scratch in IT StartUp

## Possible Procedure
- Get a talented "[studentische Hilfskraft](https://www.google.com/search?q=translate+studentische+Hilfskraft&oq=translate)", if possible with IT Background
- Appoint the person to be the official QA/QR implementer in company, make sure all agree
- QA/QR implementer goes through Checklist.md which probably will require several meetings
- Checklist is updated continuously and is under version control
- Resulting "actions items" (who does what when) are also kept in writing and under version control
- Result: QA/QR should be in a much better shape than before ;-)
